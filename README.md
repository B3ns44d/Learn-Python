# Learn Python for free

Python is one of the most significant skills you’ll need not only in data science but in any position in the development/tech world. It’s used in a variety of fields and has a reputation for being easy to learn and simple to use. Here are some useful resources to learn Python.


## What is Python?

Python is an object-oriented programming language with an emphasis on simplicity. It’s dynamic, functions well as a “glue language,” and reduces the cost of maintenance because of its readability.
It boasts a fast edit-test-debug cycle. It also has an extensive documentation library and is available for free across all major platforms. You can freely distribute it and participate in its thriving community of developers.
Learning Python puts you on the first step to a career in a variety of fields. Because it’s ubiquitous, a foundational language like Python is often one of the core requirements for working with various organizations in diverse fields as finance and healthcare. Here are a few resources that can help get you started.

## Why should we learn Python?

Many people now want to learn the hot programming language, i.e., Python. Some of them have a reason, and others don’t.
Before going to learn any programming language, question yourself that why are you going to learn it? This question gives you some clarity. And know what can you do if you teach yourself that programming language. Most probably, those two questions provide a clear idea about the plans for learning it.
It’s a good practice to know the features of programming language that you are interested to learn. And what works it can do for you? We are going to see all of them.

## Why is Python so popular?

Let’s see the features of Python, which make it one of the top programming languages.

### English like Syntax

The syntax of Python is so comfortable for beginners. If you read the Python code, you will get the feeling of reading English. It reduced the stress to remember the syntax. If you don’t believe me see the below code snippet.

```python
num = 3
if num > 0:
    print(num, "is a positive number.")
print("This is always printed.")

num = -1
if num > 0:
    print(num, "is a positive number.")
print("This is also always printed.")
```
You will get to know the greatness of the Python once you get into it.

### Libraries

Python comes with a bulk number of built-in modules and libraries. There is an ocean of libraries for Python programming language. Modules and libraries make the life of a programmer easier. They help to solve problems that can’t be solved with the standard features of Python.

### Dynamically Typed
It’s a dynamically typed language. We don’t have to worry about the declarations of the variables in coding. If you see other programming languages like C, C++, Java, etc.., we have to declare the variables using any one of the data types supported by that programming language. See example code in C language.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    double num;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%lf", &num);
    if (num <= 0.0) {
        if (num == 0.0)
            printf("You entered 0.");
        else
            printf("You entered a negative number.");
    } else
        printf("You entered a positive number.");
    return 0;
}
```

### Portability

Python follows the programming proverb, i.e., Code Once Run Anywhere. We can use the Python on any platform. You need only Python to run any Python code. Python doesn’t care about your platform.
Those are the most popular features of Python. It has a lot of other features that will help to achieve your goals in the development.

## What can we do with Python?
We can use Python in most of the software fields. Let’s see the standard and most used areas of Python.

### Machine Learning and Data Science
Python is preferred for machine learning and data science.

We can compute the complicated math equations using Python with effortless. We have libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.., which helps machine learning engineers and data scientists.

### Web Development
There are frameworks out there for web development in Python.

The most popular web frameworks for Python are Django and Flask. Django is a more robust framework than Flask. You can develop a simple website to complex web application using these frameworks.  Both frameworks are beginner-friendly and easy to learn with the documentation.

### Web Scraping
Web scraping is one of the main areas of Python.

We can make web crawlers in Python with a library called scrapy, BeautifulSoup4, and many others for scraping the data.

### Scripting
You can do literally anything to automate repetitive sysadmin tasks.

- Interacting with OS (Windows, UNIX, etc.)
- Performing maintenance
- Deploying an application
- Website testing
- Downloading data

We can also use the Python for **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** development, Games development with **PyGame**, **Network programming**, etc.., You can get a chance to explore the world of Python once you get started.

I hope you get an idea of why Python is getting so much popularity. For a growing language like Python will gives you many resources to learn. That’s a problem for beginners like me (once). We have many options to learn Python. That’s so confusing.

But don’t worry, the following are carefully curated.
